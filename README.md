## Implement the global alignment dynamic programming algorithm using an affine-gap penalty

Steps to run the file:
1.	Save the global_alignment.py in any folder.
2.	Open Putty or Secure shell and navigate to that folder where you saved the above file.
3.	Type python global_alignment.py
4.	Give Gap value = -1, Match = 1 and Mismatch = 0
5.	The output of optimal alignment score can be seen on the last line.

Note: The python file may throw errors for print and raw_input statements as they are compatible with only version 2. The code should work well with version 3 python
